# TML Code Converter

This is an attempt to convert the codes for noteshapes used in the
[Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum](http://chmtl.indiana.edu/tml) to
something more readable. For now, this means trying to convert to
[MEI](http://music-encoding.org).

All in Ruby, requires [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) for XML building...
everything else should be good to go. Contact me at mjmcclim@indiana.edu.
